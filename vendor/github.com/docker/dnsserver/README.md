# dnsserver - a simple DNS service toolkit

This provides a very basic API for programming a DNS service that serves over
UDP. Single A (non-RR) records and SRV records are currently supported,
although this may change in the future.

## Stability

This should be considered alpha quality software and is currently not suitable
for production use.
